    '"Jonah was a small circle guy, mostly home and school. Jonah\'s school, The Creekside School, is a special place filled with dedicated, hard-working professionals. Creekside is family to us, as they loved Jonah exactly as he was. Did he have bad days and really stretch them? Yes. Did they ever give up on him? No."',
