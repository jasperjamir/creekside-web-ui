    "Jonah first set eyes on an escalator at a light rail station during a school trip to a shopping mall. On the next outings, his face would light up as he watched the moving stairs for extended periods of time, rocking back and forth, and reaching over to feel the moving handrail.",
    "Staff encouraged Jonah to step onto the escalator, but each time he declined, until one day, he was ready.",
    "Jonah gingerly stepped onto the escalator, and he began leaning back as though to put as much distance as possible between himself and the experience. Meanwhile, the Creekside staff he was with propped his upper body up to make sure he wouldn't fall. As he neared the top, he was filled with pride and smiled broadly as the staff celebrated his courage.",
    "To passersby, it may have seemed an odd place for high-fives, but there was great reason to celebrate on the light rail platform that day.",
    "Jonah's experience of Creekside staff supporting his curiosity with patience and preparation is a testament to our philosophy. Our students' interests are central to their learning, and staff build on those interests to help develop important life skills for as safe and meaningful an adulthood as possible.",
